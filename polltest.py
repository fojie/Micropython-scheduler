# Poll functions will be called by the scheduler each time it determines which task to run. The thread will be scheduled
# unless the poll function returns None. When scheduled the result of the poll function - which should be an integer -
# is returned to the thread.
# The intended use of poll functions is for servicing hardware which can't raise interrupts. In such a function
# the function would clear down the device before return so that (until the device again becomes ready) subsequent calls
# would return None. Pseudocode:
# my poll funtion()
#    if hardware is ready
#        service it so that subsequent test returns not ready
#        return an integer
#    return None

# This example polls the accelerometer with a timeout, only responding to changes which exceed a threshold.
# Also demonstrates returning data from a callback by using an object method as a callback function

# The poll function is a method of the Accelerometer class defined below. Using a class method enables the
# function to retain state between calls. In this example it determines the amount of change since the last
# update and returns None if the amount of change is below a threshold: this will cause the scheduler not to
# schedule the thread. If the amount of change exceeds the threshold the Accelerometer instance's data is
# updated and the function returns 1 causing the scheduler to resume the processing thread.
