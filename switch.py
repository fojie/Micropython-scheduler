# ************************************************** SWITCH CLASS ***************************************************

# The purpose of the switch object is to work with event driven programming using the scheduler. The switch is polled:
# there is usually no merit in using interrupts for a manually operated switch, especially with a scheduler using
# cooperative multi threading.
# A switch object will call user supplied open and close callback functions when the switch is operated. Polling is
# done by running a thread which runs forever and is done in a way to ensure debouncing.
# The switch is presumed to be wired from the assigned pin to ground.
