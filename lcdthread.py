# LCD class for Micropython and scheduler.
# Author Peter Hinch.
# V1.0 21 Aug 2014

# Assumes an LCD with standard Hitachi HD44780 controller chip wired using four data lines
# Code has only been tested on two line LCD displays

# My code is based on this program written for the Raspberry Pi

# Initstring:
# 0x33, 0x32: See flowchart P24 send 3,3,3,2
# 0x28: Function set DL = 1 (4 bit) N = 1 (2 lines) F = 0 (5*8 bit font)
# 0x0C: Display on/off: D = 1 display on C, B = 0 cursor off, blink off
# 0x06: Entry mode set: ID = 1 increment S = 0 display shift??
# 0x01: Clear display, set DDRAM address = 0
# Original code had timing delays of 50uS. Testing with the Pi indicates that time.sleep() can't issue delays shorter
# than about 250uS. There also seems to be an error in the original code in that the datasheet specifies a delay of
# >4.1mS after the first 3 is sent. To simplify I've imposed a delay of 5mS after each initialisation pulse: the time to
# initialise is hardly critical. The original code worked, but I'm happier with something that complies with the spec.

# Threaded version:
# No point in having a message queue: people's eyes aren't that quick. Just display the most recent data for each line.
# Assigning changed data to the LCD object sets a "dirty" flag for that line. The LCD's runlcd thread then updates the
# hardware and clears the flag

# Note that the lcd_nybble method uses explicit delays rather than yields. This is for two reasons.
# The delays are short in the context of general runtimes and minimum likely yield delays, so won't
# significantly impact performance. Secondly, using yield produced perceptibly slow updates to the display text.
